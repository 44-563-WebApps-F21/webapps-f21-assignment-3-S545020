    <p> Wonder Woman is viewed as a feminist icon, though her appearance is just as noteworthy. 
        Her red, white, and blue star-spangled suit is among her most striking characteristics , 
        though her beauty does not serve to downplay her strength , as well as one of the most famous costumes in comic books ever. 
        The famous getup includes gauntlets of Atlas which increases the strength of the wearer by ten and these sometimes
        cause Diana trouble when it comes to controlling the sudden increase in strength.Wonder Woman is arguably the most 
        famous female superhero out there , one with a colorful history through the years. Wonder Woman, the hero's powers 
        and abilities include: superhuman strength and durability
        (both assets during big battles); the power of flight (she can glide through the air on currents in the wind); 
        superhuman speed, reflexes, and agility; finally, enhanced senses,
        including smell, vision, and hearing. Many of Wonder Woman's special powers are rooted in her divine origins.
        I have  a Super power: The power to get it done.I’d like the super power to be able to juggle homework, lessons, clubs, and more. 
        Good time management is always a hard thing; it’s tough to show up on time, 
        and resist the temptation to just stay in bed playing on your phone!
