<h1>The Yellow Namora</h1>
<body>

    <p>
        Namora is a character that originated in the Golden Age of Comic Books. Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin Namor. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter",
         as Namor means "Avenging Son". She was Namor's cousin (though not by blood), and became his companion for a period of several years.

    <h3><b>List to directions to the lair Namora</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>During her early adolescence, Namora moved to the Atlantis Antarctic capital with her father and became a playmate of Namor. </li>
        <li>A few years later, Namora and her father relocated to a northern colony and were absent when Atlantis was increasingly drawn into surface activities.</li>
        <li>In 1946, Namora's skin, formerly the typical Atlantean blue, faded to a Caucasian tone, and her father revealed her half-human heritage.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Shortly afterward, she and her father returned to Antarctic Atlantis, where, in early 1947, the Brockton Gang, 
                surface criminals led by Stoop Richards, invaded Atlantis in search of treasure, killing Namora's father</li>
            <li>Namor and Namora took vengeance on Richards and his underlings. </li>
            <li>Namora continued to accompany Namor on adventures, fighting the schemes of their cousin Byrrah and such surface criminals as the mesmeric Doctor 
                Macabre and the weapon-wielding Viking; on her own, she clashed with the Mummy Men of Tut-Ak-Mun and other threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>In 1955, Namora married an Atlantean man named Talan.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>At some point following the formation of the adventurous Monster Hunters in 1956, Namora joined the team on some of their adventures; however, 
                her marriage with Talan became strained when, due to her hybrid nature, she was unable to bear children.</li>
                <li>In late 1957, Namora persuaded the exiled 
                    Atlantean scientist Vyrra to implant her with an altered cloned embryo, enabling her to become pregnant</li>
        </ol>
